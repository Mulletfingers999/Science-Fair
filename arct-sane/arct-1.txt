The average atmospheric water vapour content has incr
eased since at least the 1980s over land and ocean as
well as in the upper troposphere. The increase is broadly
consistent with the extra water vapour that warmer
air can hold. {3.4}
•
Observations since 1961 show that the average temperature
of the global ocean has incr
eased to depths of at
least 3000 m and that the ocean has been absorbing more
than 80% of the heat added to the climate system.
Such warming causes seawater to expand, contributi
ng to sea level rise (see Table SPM-1). {5.2, 5.5}

•
Mountain glaciers and snow cover have declined on av
erage in both hemispheres. Widespread decreases in
glaciers and ice caps have contributed to sea level ri
se (ice caps do not include contributions from the
Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets). (See Table SPM-1.) {4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 5.5}
•
New data since the TAR now show that losses from the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica have
very
likely
 contributed to sea level rise over 1993 to 2003 (
see Table SPM-1). Flow speed has increased for some
Greenland and Antarctic outlet glaciers, which drain ice
from the interior of the ice sheets. The corresponding
increased ice sheet mass loss has often followed thinning,
reduction or loss of ice shelves or loss of floating
glacier tongues. Such dynamical ice loss is sufficient
to explain most of the Antarctic net mass loss and
approximately half of the Greenland net mass loss. Th
e remainder of the ice loss from Greenland has occurred
because losses due to melting have exceeded accumu
lation due to snowfall.
 {4.6, 4.8, 5.5}
•
Global average sea level rose at an average rate of 1.8
[1.3 to 2.3] mm per year over 1961 to 2003. The rate
was faster over 1993 to 2003, about 3.1 [2.4 to 3.8] mm per year. Whether the faster rate for 1993 to 2003
reflects decadal variability or an increase in
the longer-term trend is unclear. There is
high confidence
that the
rate of observed sea level rise increased from the 19th
to the 20th century. The
total 20th century rise is
estimated to be 0.17 [0.12 to 0.22] m. {5.5}
•
For 1993-2003, the sum of the climate contributions is
consistent within uncertainties with the total sea level
rise that is directly observed (see Table SPM-1). These estimates are based on improved satellite and
in-situ
data now available. For the period of 1961 to 2003, the su
m of climate contributions is estimated to be smaller
than the observed sea level rise. The TAR reported a
similar discrepancy for 1910 to 1990. {5.5}

linearly with global average temperature change, the
upper ranges of sea level rise for SRES scenarios shown
in Table SPM-3 would increase by 0.1 m to 0.2 m. La
rger values cannot be excluded, but understanding of
these effects is too limited to assess their likelihood or
provide a best estimate or an upper bound for sea level
rise. {10.6}
•
Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations
 leads to increasing acidification of the ocean.
Projections based on SRES scenarios give reductions in average global surface ocean pH
16
 of between 0.14
and 0.35 units over the 21st century, adding to the presen
t decrease of 0.1 units since pre-industrial times.
{5.4, Box 7.3, 10.4}
There is now higher confidence in
projected patterns of warming and other regional-scale features,
including changes in wind patterns, precipitation, a
nd some aspects of extrem
es and of ice. {8.2, 8.3,
8.4, 8.5, 9.4, 9.5, 10.3, 11.1}
•
Projected warming in the 21st cen
tury shows scenario-independent geographical patterns similar to those
observed over the past several decades. Warming is expected to be greatest over land and at most high
northern latitudes, and least over the Southern Ocean a
nd parts of the North Atlantic ocean (see Figure SPM-
6). {10.3}

 curves, shown in the left-

•
Snow cover is projected to contract. Widespread incr
eases in thaw depth are projected over most permafrost
regions. {10.3, 10.6}
•
Sea ice is projected to shrink in both the Arctic and
Antarctic under all SRES scenari
os. In some projections,
Arctic late-summer sea ice disappears almost entirely
by the latter part of the 21st century. {10.3}
•
It is
very likely
 that hot extremes, heat waves, and heavy preci
pitation events will continue to become more
frequent. {10.3}
•
Based on a range of models, it is
likely
 that future tropical cyclones (typhoons and hurricanes) will become
more intense, with larger peak wind speeds and more
 heavy precipitation associated with ongoing increases of
tropical SSTs. There is less confidence in projections
of a global decrease in numbers of tropical cyclones.
The apparent increase in the proportion of very intense st
orms since 1970 in some regions is much larger than
simulated by current models for that period. {9.5, 10.3, 3.8}
•
Extra-tropical storm tracks are projected to move polewar
d, with consequent changes in wind, precipitation,
and temperature patterns, continuing th
e broad pattern of observed trends over the last half-century. {3.6,
10.3}
•
Since the TAR there is an improving understanding of
projected patterns of precipitation. Increases in the
amount of precipitation are
very likely
 in high-latitudes, while decreases are
likely
 in most subtropical land
regions (by as much as about 20% in the A1B scenar
io in 2100, see Figure SPM-7), continuing observed
patterns in recent trends. {3.3, 8.
3, 9.5, 10.3, 11.2 to 11.9}
•
Based on current model simulations, it is
very likely
 that the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) of the
Atlantic Ocean will slow down during the 21st centu
ry. The multi-model average reduction by 2100 is 25%
(range from zero to about 50%) for SRES emission scenar
io A1B. Temperatures in the Atlantic region are
projected to increase despite such
changes due to the much larger wa
rming associated with projected
increases of greenhouse gases. It is
very unlikely
 that the MOC will undergo a large abrupt transition during
the 21st century. Longer-term changes in the MOC ca
nnot be assessed with confidence. {10.3, 10.7}

Anthropogenic warming and sea level rise would
continue for centuries due to the timescales
associated with climate processes and feedbacks,
even if greenhouse gas concentrations were to be
stabilized. {10.4, 10.5, 10.7}
•
Climate carbon cycle coupling is expected to add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere as the climate system
warms, but the magnitude of this feedback is uncerta
in. This increases the uncertain
ty in the trajectory of
carbon dioxide emissions required to ach
ieve a particular stabilisation level of atmospheric carbon dioxide
concentration. Based on current unders
tanding of climate carbon cycle feedback, model studies suggest that to
stabilise at 450 ppm carbon dioxide, could require that cu
mulative emissions over the 21st century be reduced
from an average of approximately 670 [630 to 710] GtC (2460 [2310 to 2600] GtCO
2
) to approximately 490
[375 to 600] GtC (1800 [1370 to 2200] GtCO
2
). Similarly, to stabilise at 1000 ppm this feedback could
require that cumulative emissions be reduced from a
model average of approximately 1415 [1340 to 1490]
GtC (5190 [4910 to 5460] GtCO
2
) to approximately 1100 [980 to 1250] GtC (4030 [3590 to 4580] GtCO
2
).
{7.3, 10.4}
•
If radiative forcing were to be stabilized in 2100 at B1 or A1B levels
11
 a further increase in global average
temperature of about 0.5°C would still be expected, mostly by 2200. {10.7}
•
If radiative forcing were to be
stabilized in 2100 at A1B levels
11
, thermal expansion alone would lead to 0.3 to
0.8 m of sea level rise by 2300 (relative to 1980–19
99). Thermal expansion would continue for many
centuries, due to the time required to trans
port heat into the deep ocean. {10.7}
•
Contraction of the Greenland ice sheet is projected to continue to contribute to sea level rise after 2100.
Current models suggest ice mass losses increase with temp
erature more rapidly than
gains due to precipitation
and that the surface mass balance becomes negative at
a global average warming (relative to pre-industrial
values) in excess of 1.9 to 4.6°C. If a negative surface
mass balance were sustained for millennia, that would
lead to virtually complete elimination of the Greenland
 ice sheet and a resulting contribution to sea level rise
of about 7 m. The corresponding future temperatures
in Greenland are comparable
to those inferred for the
last interglacial period 125,000 years ago, when paleoc
limatic information suggests
reductions of polar land
ice extent and 4 to 6 m of sea level rise. {6.4, 10.7}
•
Dynamical processes related to ice flow not included in
 current models but suggested by recent observations
could increase the vulnerability of the ice sheets to wa
rming, increasing future sea level rise. Understanding
of these processes is limited and there is no consensus on their magnitude. {4.6, 10.7}
•
Current global model studies project that the Antarctic i
ce sheet will remain too cold for widespread surface
melting and is expected to gain in mass due to incr
eased snowfall. However, net loss of ice mass could occur
if dynamical ice discharge dominates the ice sheet mass balance. {10.7}
•
Both past and future anthropogenic carbon dioxide emi
ssions will continue to contribute to warming and sea
level rise for more than a millennium, due to the
timescales required for removal of this gas from the
atmosphere. {7.3, 10.3}

The Emission Scenarios of the IPCC Special
 Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES)
17
A1. The A1 storyline and scenario fami
ly describes a future world of very
rapid economic growth
, global population
that peaks in mid-century and declines thereafter, and the
rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies.
Major underlying themes are convergence among regions, cap
acity building and increased cultural and social
interactions, with a substantia
l reduction in regional differences in per capita
 income. The A1 scenario family develops
into three groups that describe alternative directions of
technological change in the energy system. The three A1 groups
are distinguished by their technological emphasis: fossil intensive (A1FI), non-fossil energy sources (A1T), or a
balance across all sources (A1B) (where balanced is defined
as not relying too heavily on one particular energy source,
on the assumption that similar improvement rates apply
to all energy supply and end use technologies).
A2. The A2 storyline and scenario fami
ly describes a very heterogeneous world. The underlying theme is self reliance
and preservation of local identities. Fertility patterns acr
oss regions converge very slowly, which results in
continuously increasing population. Econom
ic development is primarily regiona
lly oriented and per capita economic
growth and technological change more fragmented and slower than other storylines.
B1. The B1 storyline and scenario family describes a converg
ent world with the same global population, that peaks in
mid-century and declines thereafter, as in the A1 storyline,
 but with rapid change in economic structures toward a
service and information economy, with reductions in materi
al intensity and the introduction of clean and resource
efficient technologies. The emphasis is on global solutions
to economic, social and environmental sustainability,
including improved equity, but without additional climate initiatives.
B2. The B2 storyline and scenario fami
ly describes a world in which the emph
asis is on local solutions to economic,
social and environmental sustainability. It is a world with
 continuously increasing global population, at a rate lower
than A2, intermediate levels of economic development, a
nd less rapid and more diverse technological change than in
the B1 and A1 storylines. While the scenario is also orie
nted towards environmental protection and social equity, it
focuses on local and regional levels.
An illustrative scenario was cho
sen for each of the six scenario groups A1B,
A1FI, A1T, A2, B1 and B2. All should be
considered equally sound.
The SRES scenarios do not include addi
tional climate initiatives, which means that no scenarios are included that
explicitly assume implementation of the United Nations Fr
amework Convention on Climate Change or the emissions
targets of the Kyoto Protocol.

 Emission scenarios are not assessed in this Working Group One re
port of the IPCC. This box summarizing the SRES scenarios is
