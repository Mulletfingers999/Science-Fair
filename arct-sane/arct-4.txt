orld rice production must increase by ⬇1% annually to
meet the growing demand for food that will result from
population growth and economic development (1). Most of this
increase must come from greater yields on existing cropland to
avoid environmental degradation, destruction of natural ecosystems, and loss of biodiversity (2, 3). Achieving greater yields
depends on increasing total crop biomass, because there is little
scope to further increase the proportion of that biomass allocated to grain (4). Total crop biomass is determined mainly by
crop photosynthesis and respiration losses, both of which are
sensitive to temperature (5). Future crop yields will be influenced by complex interactions between the effects of increases
in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (6) and trace gases such
as ozone (7) as well as the effects of temperature increases
brought about by climate change (8).
Global mean surface air temperature increased by ⬇0.5°C in the
20th century and is projected to further increase by 1.5 to 4.5°C in
this century (9). In the past century, daily minimum nighttime
temperature increased at a faster rate than daily maximum temperature in association with a steady increase in atmospheric
greenhouse gas concentrations (10, 11). Although the effects of
projected climate change on crop yields have been evaluated by
using crop-simulation models (8), there are few studies on the
effects of observed climate change on crop growth and yield (12,
13). In the present study, we analyzed weather data at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) Farm (Los Ban
˜os, Laguna,
Philippines) from 1979 to 2003 to evaluate trends in mean maximum and minimum temperatures and solar radiation in both dry
and wet cropping seasons. Relationships between grain yield and
temperature or radiation were evaluated by using yield data from
field experiments conducted under irrigated conditions with optimal management at the IRRI Farm from 1992 to 2003. Our
objective was to determine whether there were significant time

trends in changes of temperature or radiation and whether these
changes had an impact on grain yield.
Materials and Methods
Weather Data Collection. A weather station was set up at the

research farm of IRRI at lat 14°11⬘N, long 121°15⬘E and an
elevation of 21 m. Data recording began on January 1, 1979. The
site measures 10.5 ⫻ 9.5 m and is surrounded by irrigated rice
throughout the year. It conforms to the World Meteorological
Organization standard specifications. The experimental field in
which rice yields were measured was located within 1 km of the
weather station, and the topography is flat. The nearest mountain
peak (Mt. Makiling, ⬍1,000 m high) is located southwest of the site
at a distance of ⬇8 km. Meteorological instruments at the station
for the present study include a Gunn–Bellani radiation integrator,
a solarimeter, glass thermometers for minimum and maximum
temperatures, a psychrometer, and a thermohygrograph. The station houses additional instruments as back-up in case the main
instruments malfunction.
Before 1990, standard measurements were recorded three
times each day at 0730, 1400, and 1700 h. Since 1990, standard
measurements have been recorded daily at 0800 h. These
measurements included dry- and wet-bulb temperature, daily
minimum and maximum air temperatures, and total radiation.
The Climate Computer (CLICOM) system, developed under the
World Meteorological Organization, was used as the main
database-management tool, including comprehensive data entry, data validation, and data quality control. Historic weather
data were imported into CLICOM, which became the basis of
the station-specific limits for quality control of the incoming new
data. For a given month, CLICOM checks each entry against
global and station-specific set extreme value limits, against other
related element values, and against the previous day’s recorded
value. Set value limits were derived from published reports of the
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and
the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical
Services Administration.
Instrument performance was evaluated annually for standardization. Working standard instruments were compared with
storage standard instruments, and installed instruments at the
station were compared with working standard instruments.
Standard thermometers and psychrometers comparable with
those used by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and
Astronomical Services Administration were acquired by the
IRRI weather station. The storage standard Kipp & Zonen
(Delft, The Netherlands) solarimeter was calibrated in The
Netherlands every 5 years. Instruments installed at the station
were recalibrated before each cropping season started.

The impact of projected global warming on crop yields has been
evaluated by indirect methods using simulation models. Direct
studies on the effects of observed climate change on crop growth
and yield could provide more accurate information for assessing
the impact of climate change on crop production. We analyzed
weather data at the International Rice Research Institute Farm from
1979 to 2003 to examine temperature trends and the relationship
between rice yield and temperature by using data from irrigated
field experiments conducted at the International Rice Research
Institute Farm from 1992 to 2003. Here we report that annual mean
maximum and minimum temperatures have increased by 0.35°C
and 1.13°C, respectively, for the period 1979 –2003 and a close
linkage between rice grain yield and mean minimum temperature
during the dry cropping season (January to April). Grain yield
declined by 10% for each 1°C increase in growing-season minimum
temperature in the dry season, whereas the effect of maximum
temperature on crop yield was insignificant. This report provides a
direct evidence of decreased rice yields from increased nighttime
temperature associated with global warming.

Crop Data Collection. The IRRI Farm is located in a humid,

tropical, lowland environment that allows two and even three
rice crops per year. The standard rice-growing seasons in the
surrounding area are the dry season (from January to April) and
the wet season (from late June to September). Field experiments
were conducted at the IRRI Farm during the dry and wet
seasons of 1992–2003. The soil at the IRRI Wetland Farm was
an Andaqueptic Haplaquoll with pH ⫽ 6.0–6.6, organic C ⫽
14.4–16.2 g䡠kg⫺1, total N ⫽ 1.40–1.50 g䡠kg⫺1, and cation exchange capacity ⫽ 32.9–40.6 cmol䡠kg⫺1.
In each growing season, IR72 and other cultivars (the other
cultivars differed from season to season) were arranged in a
randomized complete-block design with four replications. IR72
is an indica inbred cultivar developed by IRRI and released in
1988 in the Philippines for irrigated lowlands. This cultivar has
been widely used in field experiments because of its high grain
yield. To eliminate genetic factors, only crop data for IR72 were
used in this study. Seedlings were raised in trays. Fourteen-dayold seedlings were transplanted between January 3rd and 22nd
in dry seasons and between June 17th and July 17th in wet
seasons. Hill spacing was 0.2 ⫻ 0.2 m, with four seedlings per hill.
Plot size was 5 ⫻ 6 m. P (30 kg䡠ha⫺1 as single superphosphate),
K (40 kg䡠ha⫺1 as KCl), and Zn (5 kg䡠ha⫺1 as zinc sulfate
heptahydrate) were applied and incorporated in all plots 1 day
before transplanting in the dry seasons. Rates of P, K, and Zn
application were reduced by 50% in wet seasons because of the
smaller yield potential compared with the dry season. In dry
seasons, plants received 200 kg䡠ha⫺1 total N as urea, which was
applied in four splits (60 kg as basal, 40 kg at midtillering, 60 kg
at panicle initiation, and 40 kg at heading) to ensure N sufficiency. In wet seasons, plants received 120 kg䡠ha⫺1 total N split
equally among those four stages. Fields were flooded 4 days after
transplanting, and a floodwater depth of 5–10 cm was maintained until 7 days before maturity, when fields were drained.
Insects, diseases, and weeds were controlled by using approved
pesticides to avoid yield loss.
Twelve hills (0.48 m2) were sampled diagonally from a 5-m2
harvest area for each replication at maturity to determine
panicle number per hill, above-ground total biomass, harvest
index, and yield components. Plants were separated into straw
and panicles. Straw dry weight was determined after oven drying
at 70°C to constant weight. Panicles were hand-threshed, and
filled spikelets were separated from unfilled spikelets by submerging them in tap water. Three subsamples of 30-g filled
spikelets and 5-g unfilled spikelets were taken to count the
number of spikelets. Dry weights of rachis and filled and unfilled
spikelets were determined after oven drying at 70°C to constant
weight. Above-ground total biomass was the summation of straw,
rachis, and filled and unfilled spikelets dry matter. Spikelets per
panicle, grain-filling percentage (100 ⫻ filled spikelet number/
total spikelet number), and harvest index (100 ⫻ filled spikelet
weight/above-ground total biomass) were calculated. Grain yield
was determined from a 5-m2 area in each replication and
adjusted to an H2O moisture content of 0.14 g䡠g⫺1 fresh weight.
The significance of time trends in changes of temperature and
radiation was determined by testing the statistical significance of
slopes at the P ⬍ 0.05 probability level according to the Student’s
t test. The relationships between yield attributes and climatic
parameters were evaluated by using correlation and partialcorrelation analyses (14).
Results and Discussion
Annual mean maximum and minimum temperatures increased by
0.35°C and 1.13°C, respectively, during the 25-year period from
1979 to 2003 (Fig. 1 A and B). The increase in minimum temperature was 3.2 times greater than the increase in maximum temperature, which is consistent with the observation that minimum
temperature has increased approximately three times as much as
9972 兩 www.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.0403720101

the corresponding maximum temperature from 1951 to 1990 over
much of the Earth’s surface (10). However, the magnitude of
increase at our site was greater than the global trend determined
over the 1950–1993 period (11). The larger increase in temperature
observed at the IRRI Farm may reflect the stronger trace-gasinduced warming during the last quarter of the 20th century. No
significant trend was observed for mean maximum temperature in
the dry season (January to April) although mean maximum temperature in the wet season (June to September) increased slightly
(Fig. 1 D and G). Mean minimum temperature increased by 1.33°C
in the dry season and by 0.80°C in the wet season from 1979 to 2003
(Fig. 1 E and H). Mean radiation also increased during the same
period (Fig. 1 C, F, and I). Radiation had a closer positive
correlation with maximum temperature than with minimum temperature. In general, higher solar radiation leads to a higher
maximum temperature and a lower minimum temperature because
of radiative cooling. Our data suggest that nighttime warming could
be greater if radiation remained stable. The temperature rise
observed at our site was unlikely caused by the local air pollution,
because these warming trends are consistent with temperature
increases found elsewhere in the Philippines and globally (11, 15).
Increase in night temperature was also observed at the Philippine
Rice Research Institute Research Farm (Mun
˜oz, Nueva Ecija,
Philippines). Mean minimum temperature during the dry season
increased 0.052°C per year at that site.
In the dry season, maximum temperature was not related to grain
yield (P ⫽ 0.65; Fig. 2A). There was a negative relationship between
grain yield and minimum temperature (P ⬍ 0.01) and a positive
relationship between grain yield and radiation (P ⬍ 0.05; Fig. 2 D
and G). Grain yield was related more closely to minimum temperature than radiation; ⬇77% and 54% of yield variation was explained by minimum temperature and radiation, respectively. The
partial-correlation coefficient between grain yield and minimum
temperature with radiation held constant was ⫺0.72. The partialcorrelation coefficient between grain yield and radiation with
minimum temperature held constant was 0.20. This partialcorrelation analysis indicates that increases in night temperature,
although small in magnitude, had a negative effect on the yield of
irrigated rice in the dry season and that the effect was independent
of radiation. In the wet season, grain yield and yield attributes were
not related to minimum temperature, maximum temperature, or
radiation (P ⬎ 0.10), which could be partially because of less
year-to-year variability in temperature and radiation in the wet
season than in the dry season from 1992 to 2003. For example, the
range in seasonal mean minimum temperature was 1.8°C in the dry
season and 0.6°C in the wet season from 1992 to 2003. Furthermore,
the occurrence of typhoons in the wet season caused crop lodging
in some years, which could weaken the relationship between yield
and climatic parameters.
There was a strong negative linear relationship between aboveground total biomass at maturity, including both grain and straw,
and minimum temperature over a very narrow range of minimum
temperature (⬍2°C) in the dry season (P ⬍ 0.01; Fig. 2E). Biomass
production decreased by ⬇10% for each 1°C increase in minimum
temperature. There was no significant relationship between cropgrowth duration and minimum temperature (P ⫽ 0.14). Therefore,
the reduction in biomass production with warm nights was not
associated with a decrease in growth duration. As was the case for
grain yield, total biomass was not related as closely to radiation as
it was to minimum temperature (Fig. 2 E and H), and there was no
significant relationship between maximum temperature and total
biomass (P ⫽ 0.91; Fig. 2B).
There was a tight negative linear relationship between spikelets per m2 and minimum temperature in the dry season (P ⬍
0.01; Fig. 2F ). Also, similar to grain and biomass yields, spikelets
per m2 were not as closely associated with radiation as with
minimum temperature (Fig. 2 F and I), and there was no
significant relationship between maximum temperature and
Peng et al.

spikelets per m2 (P ⫽ 0.37; Fig. 2C). Panicles per m2 were
negatively related to minimum temperature (P ⬍ 0.01) but not
to radiation or maximum temperature (P ⬎ 0.10). Other yield
components such as spikelets per panicle, grain-filling percentage, and grain weight were not related to minimum or maximum
temperature or radiation (P ⬎ 0.10).
There was a significant negative relationship between minimum temperature and harvest index in the dry season (P ⬍ 0.05).
Therefore, grain yield decreased by at least 10% for each 1°C
increase in growing-season minimum temperature. Daily mean
temperature is generally calculated as the average of minimum
and maximum temperatures. Because the increase in mean
minimum temperature was ⬎3-fold greater than the increase in
mean maximum temperature, we conclude that rice grain yield
declined by ⬇15% for each 1°C increase in growing-season mean
temperature. This magnitude of grain-yield reduction from an
increase in mean daily temperature is similar to the 17% decline
per degree in a regression study of trends in climate and United
States maize and soybean yields from 1982 to 1998 (12).
Our study confirms predictions from simulation studies (8, 16,
17) of substantial yield reductions caused by higher mean daily

temperature. However, yield reductions caused by global warming
predicted by simulation tend to be smaller. For example, the
simulated yield reduction from a 3°C rise in mean daily temperature
was ⬇16% for maize, wheat, sorghum, and soybean in the central
United States. (16). For rice, simulated yield potential in the major
rice-growing regions of Asia with present atmospheric CO2 concentration decreased by 7% for every 1°C rise above current mean
temperature (17).
Most studies of temperature and global warming effects on
crop growth and grain yield are based on daily mean air
temperature, which assumes no difference in the influence of day
versus night temperature. Such was the case for the simulation
studies cited above. A few studies have examined the differential
effects of changes in maximum and minimum temperatures on
crop yields. For wheat, the negative effects of a rise in mean air
temperature on simulated yields were smallest when the minimum temperature increased more than maximum temperature
(18). Although a negative effect of increased night temperature
on grain yield was reported for maize, wheat, and soybeans (19),
the effects were not compared with the effect of comparable
increases in day temperature. In a growth-chamber experiment,

season (June to September) (G–I) at the IRRI Farm. Trends (slopes) for the maximum temperature in A, D, and G and radiation in F are not statistically significant
at the P ⬍ 0.05 probability level according to the Student’s t test.

Fig. 2. The relationship between rice-yield attributes (grain yield, above-ground total biomass, and spikelets per m2) and growing-season mean maximum
temperature (A–C), minimum temperature (D–F), or radiation (G–I). Yield-attribute data were obtained from irrigated field experiments in which cropmanagement practices were optimized to achieve the highest possible yields from rice cultivar IR72 at the IRRI Farm in the dry seasons from 1992 to 2003.
Growing-season mean maximum and minimum temperatures and radiation were calculated from daily values for the entire growing season from transplanting
to harvest.

increasing night temperature from 21 to 29°C at a constant day
temperature of 29°C reduced total biomass production of rice
plants by ⬇20%, but the difference was statistically insignificant
(20). At a constant day temperature of 33°C, increasing night
temperature from 25 to 33°C resulted in a significant reduction
in grain-filling percentage and grain yield.
This report provides direct evidence of decreased rice yields from
increased night temperature associated with global warming. The
physiological mechanisms that caused the observed decrease in rice
yield and the differential effect of increases in night versus day
temperature are unknown. Although the physiological effects of
extremely high temperature on rice yield are well understood (21,
22), the effects of small increases in temperature associated with
global warming are poorly understood. We know that plant maintenance respiration increases with increasing temperature (23, 24)
and that a greater rate of maintenance respiration reduces the
amount of assimilates available for growth and yield (25). However,
reported yield reductions in maize, wheat, and soybeans under
increased night temperature cannot be fully explained by effects on
9974 兩 www.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.0403720101

respiration (19). Plant acclimation to warmer night temperature
may explain the relatively small increase in respiration (26, 27).
Other mechanisms also may contribute to the observed yield
reduction such as differential effects of night versus day temperature on tillering, leaf-area expansion, stem elongation, grain filling,
and crop phenological development. If so, current crop-growth
models will need further refinement to account for the differential
effects of minimum and maximum temperatures on respiration,
morphological traits, and phenological development and thus more
accurately simulate the influence of increased temperature under
climate-change scenarios (28). The results of this study highlight the
need for greater fundamental understanding of the effects of night
temperature on physiological processes governing crop growth and
yield development.
