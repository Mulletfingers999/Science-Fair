Tonight's meltdown comes to you from the Arctic Sea, now for our viewers in the Arctic, turns out there's no need to panic! You know all that ice that had supposedly melted? It's been found!

Let me explain. That is an area the size of California. Now the error was the result of what the NSIDC calls "sensor drift". This colossal miscalculation was first pointed out by curious readers who located far more ice covered areas in the Arctic than had been originally reported by the center. What's a little, you know, grounding in the service of a higher cause, global warming hysteria.
